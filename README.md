Outdoor Christmas Lights Synced with Music using Arduino and Relays

I created this project after seeing various Christmas light shows over the years. I wanted to be able to sync christmas music to the lights on my house. I discovered a program called Vixen which allows you to manually turn on and off different light channels along with music. The program can communicated with the tx/rx pins of an arduino board to set pins to HIGH/LOW. Then, I hand soldered a pcb that includes 5 relays used to control the lights, as well as outlets to connect 5 strands of christmas lights to. All of the test code I wrote myself, but the vixentest.ino code was found [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l3K5VBD4pNWjdyDPErNWgPkwEWZJi99w/view)
